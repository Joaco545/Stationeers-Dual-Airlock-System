Dual Airlock System
Objective: Have 2 airlocks that are on an inverted state

Doors: ArL_Door - [NAME] - [INT/EXT] - [1/2]
Sensors: Arl_Sen - [NAME] - [1/2]
Vents: Arl_Vent - [NAME] - [INT/EXT] - [1/2]


1 airlock: 2 doors, 1 gas sensor, 2 active vents; 5/6 pins used, last pin for coms?

airlock steps:
Close the door
Drain towards current till void
Turn off vent
Turn on other vent to fill to pressure target
Open other door

Coms states:
0 - Initializing
1 - Cycling
2 - Open to INT (oti)
3 - Open to EXT (ote)
4 - Ready to Sync

Code init:
Set coms to init
Wait for other to init
Get current state
Save state to register
Set coms to state
Wait for other coms > 1
Compare state
if other state != my state
    start main loop
if other state == my state (else)
    set coms to 4
    wait till other also shows 4
    place a randomly generated number on other Setting
    wait till yours is not 4
    compare and cycle if lowest

check state: (int = oti = 2 | ext = ote = 3)
if any door is open
    return that
if pressure > min(ext/int)
    return int
else
    PANIC!

main:
[some code]
goto main

cycle:
[some code]
goto main
